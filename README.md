The Digital Mirror is a concept of this project that shows the useful information on a big screen that is centred somewhere in the house where all the family members can see it and get updates at a glance. 

The Digital screen is an idea of this project, where MagicMirror platform is utilised for providing common output on a big screen for family members where everyone can see it. The interface shows the potential and relative information on the screen to assist the family members where all the devices in the home are connected to the system. The rationale is to provide a solution that provides common information that is synced from devices across the home from all the members residing. This information and synced data are then transformed and used for predicting the potential information that is useful for other members. The necessary information like calendar, events, notifications for events, time and other home automation appliances that make use of IoT will be connected to produce a common access point.
